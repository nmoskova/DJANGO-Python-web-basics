Project Petstagram

Petstagram is Django Project which we created throughout the course Python-Web_basics at SoftUni.
The project covers the following functionalities: creating a user profile; a user could view all photos of pets, open details, like a photo, edit and delete them.There are "create", "edit", and  "delete" forms for each pet. "create" and "edit" forms for the profile and a photo. The profile is deleted with a confirmation page, and a photo is deleted directly through the button "Delete".

Templates were provided by SoftUni and the workshop was finished during the course with our lecturer Doncho Minkov. It is not an individual work. The project is done following the steps of Doncho Minkov.
